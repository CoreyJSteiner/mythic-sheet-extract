#Mythic Bastionland: Sheets

A simple pdf to png extractor for getting Knight and Myth data given a die roll of d6 and d12.

This tool is inteded for use my referees in order to distribute character sheets and organize world information for their campaign (without putting too much wear on their books).

This tool requires that you already have the Mythic Bastionland PDF locally. The file is not transmitted elsewhere in order to perform the extraction.
